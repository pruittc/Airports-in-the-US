# Airports-in-the-US
This file examines all the airports within the United States. It shows airports with and without control towers. Besides the different colors identifying the control tower availability, a bubble will pop up indicating a "Y" for yes, and a "N" for no, if the airplane is clicked upon. The basemap was from Leaflet-providers. Airport geogjson data was provided by USGS and the US-stated geogjson data was provided by Mike Bostock of D3. The airplane icon was from Font Awesome. Libraries were used from jQuery, Javascript, Chroma, and Google Fonts. I would like to thank Jared for helping me tremendously.
